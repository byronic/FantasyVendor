I. About

Fantasy Vendor is a humorous text-based game in which you take on the role of a storekeeper in a marvelous realm of high fantasy (some restrictions may apply). 

Fantasy Vendor was funded successfully through Kickstarter and therefore released as open-source. Anyone is free to make derivative works or otherwise make it under a different name. Please contact us first, though. :)

II. FAQ

. How do I download and play the game?
  Great question. From the commit list:
	1. click 'Fantasy Vendor.exe'
	2. click 'View Raw' to download the file
	3. run the downloaded file
. What are the minimum system requirements?
  Another great question.
  The program is written in C# for the console.
  To run the .exe version requires Windows with .NET 2.0 or later.
  .NET is free, and available from Microsoft.
  To play the game on Linux/Mac requires SharpDevelop or MonoDevelop, opening Code.cs and compiling.
  But, if you're playing on Linux you probably already got started.
