Fantasy Vendor is a successfully backed Kickstarter project.

Version 1.55 is fully functional, but the sum total of Kickstarter kudos and features is still in the process of being added. 

FAQ:
 . How do I download and play the game? 
	Great question. From the commit list:
	 1. click 'FV Version 1-55 NOT FINAL.exe'
	 2. click 'View Raw' to download the file
	 3. run the downloaded file
 . What are the minimum system requirements?
	Another good question.
	The program is written in C# as a Console Windows program.
	To run the .exe version requires Windows with .NET 2.0 or later.
	.NET is free, and available from Microsoft.
	To play the game on Linux/Mac requires SharpDevelop or MonoDevelop, opening Code.cs and re-compiling.
	But, if you're playing on Linux you probably already started playing.

Known bugs, to be corrected in next version:
 . Four known grammatical / spacing errors
 . Certain menus do not intercept invalid key data, instead printing it to the screen
 . Kickstarter backer thanks list is not complete and is dismissable via keystroke
 . Certain offensive terms / language choices are up for removal

Kindly alert me to any questions or concerns!
